## 2. Exclusive Data Editing Feature

### Goals

- Implement a feature to allow exclusive editing rights to a single user at a time for specific data fields, enhancing data integrity and collaboration efficiency.

### Planned Improvements

- Develop a mechanism that locks data fields during editing by one user and displays these fields as read-only to others.

### Impact

- Reduces conflicts and enhances data integrity during collaborative sessions.
- Provides a clear indication of data being actively edited, improving the collaborative user experience.

## 3. Cloud Storage Integration

### Goals

- Expand data storage solutions and enhance data accessibility by integrating with cloud storage, specifically Amazon S3.

### Planned Improvements

- **Setup S3 Bucket for Database File Storage**: Configure an S3 bucket to store DuckDB database files, ensuring data is accessible and backed up in the cloud.

### Impact

- Ensures high availability and redundancy of data.
- Facilitates data sharing and scalability by leveraging cloud storage capabilities.
